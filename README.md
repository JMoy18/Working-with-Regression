# Working with Regression

This application I created has two parts.

The first function, simple_linear_regression intakes a dataset in dataframe form and given the independent varaiable and dependent varaible, will output an anaylsis of variance (ANOVA) table that can be used for further statistical anaylsis.

The second function, regression_graph intakes a dataset and outputs a scatter plot with the regression equation overlayed. Additionally, the function also outputs the equation that was used to create the regression line. 

I currently plan to expand this code by implimenting mulitiple regression and other crucial staistical operations and functions
